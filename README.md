# Project: Superstore Sales Performance Analysis Using Python

# Introduction:

This project aims to analyze the sales data of a superstore to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and profitability using Python and its data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The analysis includes examining customer segments, order priorities, yearly sales trends, shipping modes, and profitability based on product categories.

# Objectives
- Understand the distribution of sales across different regions, customer segments, and product categories.
- Identify the most and least profitable products and categories.
- Analyze the shipping modes and their impact on delivery times and costs.
- Examine customer purchasing behavior and identify key customer segments.
- Visualize sales trends over time.

# Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales trends visualization
- Product-wise sales analysis
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Interactive visualizations

# Tools and Libraries
